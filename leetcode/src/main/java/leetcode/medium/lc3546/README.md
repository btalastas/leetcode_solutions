# Equal Sum Partition I

You are given an `m x n` matrix grid of positive integers. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make either one horizontal or one vertical cut on the grid such that:

- Each of the two resulting sections formed by the cut is non-empty.
- The sum of the elements in both sections is equal.

Return true if such a partition exists; otherwise return false.

Example 1:

```java
Input: grid = [[1,4],[2,3]]

Output: true

Explanation:

A horizontal cut between row 0 and row 1 results in two non-empty sections, each with a sum of 5. Thus, the answer is true.
```

Example 2:

```java
Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,4]]

Output: false

Explanation:

No horizontal or vertical cut results in two non-empty sections with equal sums. Thus, the answer is false.
```
